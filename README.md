HW1: Get on the Web

This is a basic html with css site introducing a little bit about myself.

Questions:
1) Name one thing you like about using GitHub and one about using Cpanel hosting.

I enjoyed the ability to upload my files straight from my terminal in VSCode to my repository in GitHub - the process is quick and simple after knowing how to use the basic git commands lines. For cPanel, I also found it really simple to use in terms of uploading files and hosting in a temporary website host.

2) What was the most satisfying part of this assignment?

I really had fun adding more styling and personalizing my html and css contents. I thought deciding what font to use, what color the background look, and anything else was an intricate process, but nevertheless a good problem to have which I was willing to put my time and effort. This made me appreciate the level of attention to detail of how a good website is structured and produced.
